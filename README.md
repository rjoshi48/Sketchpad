    - A mode to draw rectangles
    - A mode to draw ellipses
    - A mode to draw special cases of these (squares and circles)
    - A mode to draw polygons (open and closed polygons)

    In addition the user can select a colour for any of the graphical objects that are about to be drawn. 

    ## Additional functions:

    - Move the selected object to a new location
    - Cut the object from the drawing (delete a graphical object)
    - Paste the selected object (copy and paste) to a new location

    ## Advanced functions:
    - Group the object with another object (possibly creating groups of arbitrary objects)
